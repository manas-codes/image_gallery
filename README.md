# Image Gallery Project

This project is a simple image gallery application that fetches images from the [Picsum Photos API](https://picsum.photos/). It allows users to view a collection of random images provided by the API.

## Technologies Used
- React: This project is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- CSS: Styling is done using CSS to ensure a visually appealing layout.
- Fetch API: The Fetch API is used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to fetch images from the Picsum Photos API.
- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be compatible with both web and mobile devices, providing a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.

## Features
- Dynamic Image Loading: Images are fetched dynamically from the Picsum Photos API, allowing for a varied and constantly updated gallery.
- Lazy Loading: Images are lazily loaded to improve performance and reduce initial load times.
- Load More Button: Users can load additional images by clicking the "Load More" button, fetching the next set of images from the API.

## Compatibility
This image gallery application is compatible with both web browsers and mobile devices. It is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across various devices.
